-- With our dataset prepped and objectives set, it's time to uncover key insights. Let's analyze! ðŸ“Š

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2; -- The dataset contains 3,248 rows. Let's explore!

-- First, let's determine the date range covered in our dataset.
SELECT MIN(`date`), MAX(`date`)
FROM layoffs_staging2;
-- The dataset includes layoffs from March 11, 2020, to November 22, 2024.
-- This period starts right after the COVID-19 lockdowns and extends up to the date the data was retrieved.

-- Let's identify the largest single layoff event recorded.
SELECT MAX(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2;
-- The highest number of employees laid off in one instance is 15,000.

-- Now, let's check the maximum percentage of workforce layoffs.
SELECT MAX(percentage_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2;
-- The maximum percentage is 1, meaning some companies laid off their entire workforce.

-- Let's identify companies that laid off their entire workforce.
SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE percentage_laid_off = 1
ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC;
-- We have 288 rows returned. "Katerra" ranks highest with 2,434 employees laid off.

-- Now, let's analyze total layoffs per company.
SELECT company, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY company
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- The query returns 2,350 unique companies. Amazon leads with 27,840 total layoffs.

/*
Top 10 companies by total layoffs:
1. Amazon - 27,840
2. Meta - 21,000
3. Intel - 16,057
4. Microsoft - 14,708
5. Tesla - 14,500
6. Cisco - 14,300
7. Google - 13,472
8. Dell - 12,650
9. Salesforce - 11,140
10. SAP - 11,000
*/

-- Now, let's analyze total layoffs by industry.
SELECT industry, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY industry
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- The query returns 31 unique industries. Retail leads with 71,703 total layoffs.

/*
Top 5 industries by total layoffs:
1. Retail - 71,703
2. Consumer - 71,046
3. Other - 61,912
4. Transportation - 60,548
5. Hardware - 54,870
*/

-- Moving on to layoffs by country.
SELECT country, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY country
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- The query returns 60 unique countries. The US dominates with 455,331 total layoffs.

/*
Top 5 countries by total layoffs:
1. United States - 455,331
2. India - 56,469
3. Germany - 28,572
4. United Kingdom - 20,090
5. Netherlands - 19,005
*/
-- The US stands out significantly compared to other countries!

-- Now, let's analyze total layoffs by date to identify peak layoff periods.
SELECT `date`, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY `date`
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- The query returns 882 unique dates.

/*  
Top 5 dates with the highest layoffs:
1. 2023-01-04 - 16,171
2. 2024-08-01 - 15,180
3. 2022-11-16 - 14,926
4. 2023-01-20 - 14,682
5. 2024-04-15 - 14,000
*/

-- Now, let's check total layoffs by year to uncover trends over time.
SELECT YEAR(`date`), SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY YEAR(`date`)
ORDER BY 1 DESC;

/*
Total layoffs by year:
2024 - 149,006
2023 - 264,220
2022 - 164,319
2021 - 15,823
2020 - 80,998
*/

-- 2023 recorded the highest total layoffs.
-- Also, the significant difference between 2020 and 2021 suggests that the 2020 layoffs were likely influenced by COVID-19 lockdowns!

-- Now, let's analyze total layoffs by company stage to see which stage had the most layoffs.
SELECT stage, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY stage
ORDER BY 2 DESC;
-- Companies in the "Post-IPO" stage had the highest total layoffs, with 375,102.

-- Let's track layoffs by month for each year to observe patterns over time.
SELECT SUBSTRING(`date`, 1, 7) AS `MONTH`, SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY `MONTH`
ORDER BY 1;
-- This will help us visualize month-to-month layoff trends across multiple years.

-- Now, let's analyze the progression of layoffs over time using a rolling sum.
WITH Rolling_Total AS
(
    SELECT SUBSTRING(`date`, 1, 7) AS `MONTH`, SUM(total_laid_off) AS sum_of_total
    FROM layoffs_staging2
    GROUP BY `MONTH`
    ORDER BY 1
)
SELECT `MONTH`, sum_of_total, SUM(sum_of_total) OVER(ORDER BY `MONTH`) AS rolling_total
FROM Rolling_Total;
-- This query provides the total layoffs per month and a cumulative rolling sum to observe long-term trends.

-- Let's examine layoffs by company per year to see which companies had the highest layoffs annually.
SELECT company, YEAR(`DATE`), SUM(total_laid_off)
FROM layoffs_staging2
GROUP BY company, YEAR(`DATE`)
ORDER BY 1;
-- This breakdown will help us track layoff trends for each company across different years.

-- Now, let's rank companies by the highest total layoffs in a given year.  
SELECT company, YEAR(`DATE`), SUM(total_laid_off)  
FROM layoffs_staging2  
GROUP BY company, YEAR(`DATE`)  
ORDER BY 3 DESC;  
-- We observe that major corporations like Amazon, Intel, Tesla, Google, and Microsoft are among the top in layoffs.  

-- Let's determine which companies had the highest layoffs each year by ranking them.
WITH Company_Year (company, years, total_laid_off) AS
(
    SELECT company, YEAR(`DATE`), SUM(total_laid_off)
    FROM layoffs_staging2
    GROUP BY company, YEAR(`DATE`)
)
SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY years ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC) AS ranking
FROM Company_Year
ORDER BY years, ranking;
-- This query assigns a rank to each company based on layoffs per year, helping us identify the top companies with the most layoffs annually.

/*
Key findings:
- 2020: Uber had the highest layoffs.
- 2021: ByteDance led layoffs.
- 2022: Meta had the most layoffs.
- 2023: Amazon ranked first.
- 2024: Intel topped the layoffs.
*/

-- Let's filter the top 5 companies with the highest layoffs per year.
WITH Company_Year (company, years, total_laid_off) AS
(
    SELECT company, YEAR(`DATE`), SUM(total_laid_off)
    FROM layoffs_staging2
    GROUP BY company, YEAR(`DATE`)
),
Company_Year_Rank AS
(
    -- Assigning a ranking to each company based on layoffs per year.
    SELECT *, DENSE_RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY years ORDER BY total_laid_off DESC) AS ranking
    FROM Company_Year
)
-- Filtering to keep only the top 5 companies for each year.
SELECT *
FROM Company_Year_Rank
WHERE ranking <= 5;

-- Now, we have the top 5 companies with the highest layoffs for each year.

==============================================
Future Steps:
==============================================

- Conduct further analysis by adding external economic indicators to understand correlations.
- Use visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Power BI) to create dynamic dashboards.
- Explore additional factors such as company size, revenue impact, and hiring trends.

This SQL analysis provides a foundational understanding of layoffs, but further statistical and predictive modeling could deepen insights.
